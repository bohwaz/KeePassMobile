## What is KeePassMobile?

The PC programm KeePass is a widely used, feature rich, free, secure, award winning password manager software for Windows and .NET platforms written by Dominik Reichl. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key and/or a key file. KeePass is known and highly appreciated for its security. Therefore even companies' IT departments store their admin/root passwords in KeePass databases!

Moreover, because of it's open architecture KeePass is supported on a variety of different platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Pocket PC, ...).

KeePassMobile is a password manager software for mobile phones (J2ME platform) that is compatible to KeePass. With KeePassMobile you are able to store all your passwords in a highly-encrypted KeePass (1.x*) database on your mobile phone and view them on the go!

Main Features

* Nice, intuitive UI (touch support is already well advanced)
* Loads (decrypt), creates, updates & saves (encrypt) KeePass 1.x databases(*)
* Password, Keyfile & Password+Keyfile encryption/decryption support
* Attachment support
* Search password entries
* Password generator
* Automatic backup of changed/deleted password entries
* Automatically closes the database when idle (security timeout)

(*) KeePassMobile runs on the J2ME platform for mobiles. Due to the capabilities of mobile phones, this platform is very limited. For this reason I do not plan to support KeePass 2.x databases that have enhanced resource requirements. See the differents of both versions here: http://www.keepass.info/compare.html
